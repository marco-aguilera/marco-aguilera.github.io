    </h2>

    <p class="Intro">
        I have been an artist at heart for most of my life. I decided <br> to
        put that aside for the tech field where I wanted to explore <br> a community that is shaping the way
        we use technology <br> in our everyday lives. I am now a senior at UNT majoring <br> in Information
        Technology with a passion for Software <br> Development and a love for Design.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        
        I have been a project manager in a veriaty of Web Development <br> Projects using html, css, javascript, php, and mysql. I have <br> also worked with
        c/c++, java, and python extensively. I am a <br> person that has a passion for learning all the
        new tools <br> & technologies that are making innovative chages in our lifes.
